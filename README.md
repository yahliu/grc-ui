[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/open-cluster-management/grc-ui.svg?token=2jHocNax82kqKsGV1uTE&branch=main)](https://travis-ci.com/open-cluster-management/grc-ui)

The UI microservice, `grc-ui`, is the governance and risk dashboard for Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management. (See [`grc-ui-api`](https://github.com/open-cluster-management/grc-ui-api) for the API Server microservice it uses)

## Design

The UI Platform is developed as an isomorphic React application. View the list of major components that are used to build this service:

* NodeJS
* Express
* React
* Handlebars
* Redux
* Webpack
* Babel
* Apollo/GraphQL
* IBM Carbon Design System
* RedHat PatternFly
* Jest
* Nightwatch


## Build

- Install the modules

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
- Build the project

   ```bash
      npm run build
   or npm run build:watch
   or npm run build:production
   ```

## Run installation

**SECURITY WARNING:** The GRC UI provides an SSL certificate in `/sslcert` that is open to the public. In order to run this in production, you'll need to replace these certificates. For our production builds, we replace these certificates using its Helm chart.

1. The following environment variables need to be set to point to a running Openshift cluster. Your environment might resemble the following content:

   ```json
   {
      "NODE_ENV": "development",
      "headerUrl": "<url-to-rhacm-console>",
      "API_SERVER_URL": "<url-to-openshift-apiserver>",
      "SERVICEACCT_TOKEN": "<openshift-token-to-authenticate>",
      "OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID": "multicloudingress",
      "OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET": "multicloudingresssecret",
      "OAUTH2_REDIRECT_URL": "https://localhost:3000/multicloud/policies/auth/callback",
   }
   ```

   The `SERVICEACCT_TOKEN` expires so if you need to get a new one:
   - From the UI...
      - Go to the RHACM Hub, enter the Hub login info, and hit “configure client” from the menu in the top right
   - With the CLI...
      - Login to the RHACM Hub with `oc` using the API Server URL and run
      
         ```bash
         oc whoami -t
         ```

2. Start the server for production by running the following command:

   ```bash
   npm run start:production
   ```

3. Start the server for development by running the following commands:

   ```bash
   npm run build:watch
   npm run start
   ```

   - Start the API server alongside it. See: [`grc-ui-api`](https://github.com/open-cluster-management/grc-ui-api)

5.Open a browser to `https://localhost:3000/multicloud/policies` and log in using your cluster admin credentials.

## Testing

### Unit Tests

Run the following command to start all unit tests (run through Jest):

```bash
npm run test:unit
```

### E2E Tests

**Note**: To run E2E tests, you'll need to install `chromedriver` before the first run or the test run will fail immediately:

```bash
npm install chromedriver
```
### Cypress Tests
**Note**: To run Cypress tests, you'll need to add necessary values in `cypressEnvConfig.yaml` file. e.g. `multicloud-console.apps.{BASE_DOMAIN}`.

**Note**: It is required that the UI runs locally or can target a remote cluster to start the selenium based tests.

1. The RBAC tests require a set of users to exist in the remote cluster. To set up these users, first log in to your remote cluster. Decide on a password you'd like to use for these users. Then, from the `grc-ui` folder, run these commands (the script will also export `SELENIUM_USER`, `SELENIUM_PASSWORD`, and `SELENIUM_USER_SELECT` to match the RBAC users and use in place of `kubeadmin`):

   ```bash
   export RBAC_PASS=<your-rbac-password>
   ./build/rbac-setup.sh
   ```

   Alternatively, you can set `DISABLE_CANARY_TEST` to `true` to disable tests that would fail in the canaries like RBAC.

   For reference, the following users will be created:

   | USER | ACCESS | ROLE |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | e2e-cluster-admin-cluster | Cluster | cluster-admin |
   | e2e-admin-cluster | Cluster | admin |
   | e2e-edit-cluster | Cluster | edit |
   | e2e-view-cluster | Cluster | view |
   | e2e-group-cluster | Cluster | view |
   | e2e-cluster-admin-ns | Namespace | cluster-admin for `e2e-rbac-test-1` |
   | e2e-admin-ns | Namespace | admin for `e2e-rbac-test-1`</br>view for `e2e-rbac-test-2` |
   | e2e-edit-ns | Namespace | edit for `e2e-rbac-test-1` |
   | e2e-view-ns | Namespace | view for `e2e-rbac-test-1` |
   | e2e-group-ns | Namespace | view for `e2e-rbac-test-1` |

2. Before you run any end-to-end (e2e) test, make sure the environment parameters `selenium_user` and `selenium_password` are set. If they are not set you can re-run the `rbac-setup.sh` script or to use the `kubeadmin` user, run the following commands:

   ```bash
   export SELENIUM_USER=UI_USERNAME
   export SELENIUM_PASSWORD=UI_PASSWORD
   ```

3. **Optional**: By default, e2e test runs against https://localhost:3000. You can run e2e test against a specific remote cluster. Set the environment parameter, `SELENIUM_CLUSTER` by running the following command:

   ```bash
   export SELENIUM_CLUSTER=https://target.base.url
   ```

4. Run the following command to start the e2e test:

   ```bash
   npm run test:e2e
   ```

   To run the tests headless (i.e. with the browser running in the background):

   ```bash
   npm run test:e2e-headless
   ```

  **Note**: The build process leverages the Dll and DllReference plugins to extract vendor plugins for faster build times and improve browser caching.  A separate bundle is created for 3rd-party client-side libraries.  The generated bundle is sourced (_public/dll.vendor.js_) along with its manifest (_vendor-manifest.json_).  If new client dependencies are added or existing versions of dependencies are updated, this module needs to be regenerated and recommitted back into source control. Run the following command  `npm run build:dll`.
