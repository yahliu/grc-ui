# grc-ui[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/open-cluster-management/grc-ui.svg?token=1xoYGv8XzWhB2heDk2My&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/open-cluster-management/grc-ui)
The UI microservice, `grc-ui` uses the `platform-ui` environment from IBM Hybrid Cloud Manager.

## Design

The UI Platform is developed as an isomorphic react application. View the list of major components that are used to build this service:

* NodeJS
* Express
* React
* Dust
* Redux
* Webpack 3
* Babel
* Apollo/GraphQL
* Bluemix Carbon
* Jest
* Nightwatch


## Build

<pre>
export ARTIFACTORY_PWD=xxx && npm install
You can get the value of ARTIFACTORY_PWD from: https://ibm.ent.box.com/notes/287638278960
   npm run build
or npm run build:watch
or npm run build:production
</pre>

## Run installation

1. You must configure an existing cluster to support local development. Complete the following steps:

   1. SSH into your existing cluster with the following command: `make ssh`
   2. Install `jq` if it is not already installed by running the following command: `sudo apt-get install jq -y`
   3. Run the following command to create a file with the environment variables from the `platform-ui` folder:
      `curl https://raw.github.ibm.com/IBMPrivateCloud/platform-ui/master/setup-dev.sh?token=<token> | sudo bash`
      
     * You can also copy and run the script from [IBMPrivateCloud/platform-ui repository](https://github.ibm.com/IBMPrivateCloud/platform-ui/blob/master/setup-dev.sh).

2. The following environment variables need to be set. View the [shared dev env](https://ibm.ent.box.com/notes/291748731101) to get the values. Your environment might resemble the following content:

<pre>
hcmUiApiUrl=https://localhost:4000/hcmuiapi
headerUrl
OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID
OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET
OAUTH2_REDIRECT_URL=https://localhost:3000/multicloud/policies/auth/callback
SERVICEACCT_TOKEN
API_SERVER_URL
</pre>

3. Start the server for production by running the following command:

<pre>
npm run start:production
</pre>

4. Start the server for development by running the following commands:

<pre>
npm run build:watch
npm run start
</pre>

5.Open a browser to `https://localhost:{httpPort}/multicloud` and log in using your cluster admin credentials.

## Storybook

To view the storybook, run the following command:

<pre>
npm run storybook
</pre>

Launch your storybook at: http://localhost:6006/.

## Testing

Run the following command to start all unit tests and selenium based tests. **Note**: It is required that the UI runs locally or can target a remote cluster to start the selenium based tests. Run the following command:

<pre>
npm run test:unit
</pre>

Before you run any end-to-end (e2e) test, set the environment parameters, `selenium_user` and `selenium_password` by running the following command:

<pre>
export SELENIUM_USER=UI_USERNAME
export SELENIUM_PASSWORD=UI_PASSWORD
</pre>

By default, e2e test runs against https://localhost:3000. You can run e2e test against a specific remote cluster. 

First, set the environment parameter, `SELENIUM_CLUSTER` by running the following command:

<pre>export SELENIUM_CLUSTER=https://target.base.url</pre>

Then run the following command to start the e2e test:

<pre>
npm run test:e2e
</pre>

| Command                          | Description                                                                                                                      |

  **Note**: The build process leverages the Dll and DllReference plugins to extract vendor plugins for faster build times and improve browser caching.  A separate bundle is created for 3rd-party client-side libraries.  The generated bundle is sourced (_public/dll.vendor.js_) along with its manifest (_vendor-manifest.json_).  If new client dependencies are added or existing versions of dependencies are updated, this module needs to be regenerated and recommitted back into source control. Run the following command  `npm run build:dll`.
